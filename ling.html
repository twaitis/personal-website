				<strong>Linguistics</strong> is the study of language and its structure. When I came to the United States, I did not know English. I struggled a lot because of language. Google Translation tool was helpful, but not enough. My native language is Arabic, which belongs to the Semitic family of languages. Semitic languages have different structure from the Germanic languages. For that reason, learning English is more difficult for people who speak Arabic than others who speak Spanish or German. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I earned a minor in Linguistics from East Carolina University. Studying linguistics gave me the opportunity to study the background of linguistic theory, the applications of language and its theory in the learning and teaching of second foreign languages, and the social and cultural uses of language in society and communication.
			</p>
			<p>
				My English improved a lot after taking linguistics courses. All of my linguistics professors have asked me to share my experiance with their students. They also asked me to give examples from my native language 'Arabic' during the lecture.

				They did not offer the Computational Linguistics major or minor in East Carolina University. The only Computer Science courses that are related to Computational Linguistics are Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing. I used technology a lot to help me when I was struggling with English. In the future, I will continue learning by my own about Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing.

				<strong>Computational Linguistics</strong> is an interdisciplinary field concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective, as well as the study of appropriate computational approaches to linguistics questions.

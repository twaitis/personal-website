				I learned a lot of skills during my college experiance. I am an effictive communicator fluent in both Arabic and English with supervisory and leadership experiance as a student. My primary focus areas are VMWare, Logic Circuits, Python, SQL database, Java, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I used HTML and CSS to create this website.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am proficient in Microsoft Office applications, data visualization tools "Tableau", and data analysis tools. Also, a certified Internet Web Professional.
			</p>
			<p>
				A creative problem solver insterested in data science, culture, anthropologic, politics and international affairs utilizing technology to streamline communication.
			</p>
			<p>
				My favorite programming language is Python, but I am also familiar with Java programming. The reason why I like python more is because of its beautiful syntact and I think its the perfect language for data science. I am also interested in Machine Learning and Computational Linguistics, and Python is very useful in those fields.

				I used my leadership skills a lot in college. I joined the Naional Society of Leadership and Success and became an inducted leader. From Fall 2017 to Fall 2018, I was the Social Coordinator for the ECU Arab Students Union. I was also the Secretary of ECU MSA from Fall 2016 to Spring 2017.

			<p><strong>Experiance:</strong></p>
			<p>
				I do not have any professional work experiance. I graduated from East Carolina University in December, 2019. Since then, I have been applying for jobs in the computer science field. It has been difficult for everyone to find jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When I was a student, I've worked on a lot of programming assignments and projects. For example, I worked on a database project, where I had to build a database using sql. Also, used sql queries to update and select some data from the database.
			</p>
			<p>
				After graduation, I decided to find a way to keep practicing my skills in programming. I found many free online courses that provides challenges and projects for learners. For example, dataquests website.

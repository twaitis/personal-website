Practicing html and css by creating my personal website
I use this website to introduce myself when applying for jobs.

I hosted this website at myweb.ecu.edu, because I was a student at East Carolina University

this is the link to this website on the internet: http://myweb.ecu.edu/student/twaitis15/SamTwaiti/index.html

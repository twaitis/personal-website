				I was born and eaised in Yemen. A country that is located in the south-east of Asia or the Arabian Peninsula. My home town Ibb city is well known for its water falls and the green mountains around the city. It is one of the few green places in the Arabian Peninsula.
			</p>
			<p>
				Coming from Yemen to the United States was a great experiance. I have learned a lot of new things. Yemen is known of its ancient history. It has a strategic location, which made the country a meeting point for many human civilizations. The background image of this webpage is a view from the city of Old Sanaa, the capital of Yemen.
			</p>
			<p>
				I moved to the United States in 2009. I was only 17 years old. Coming to the United States is a great experiance. I have leanred a lot of new things, and experianced some challenges. One of the challenges was language, but now I am a linguist. In 2009, I became a <strong>US citizen</strong>, which was a great change in my life. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I like swimming more than any sports. There are many beautiful beaches in Eastern Cost of the United States, which I have visited. East Carolina University is only 2 hours aways from Carolina Beach, which made going to the beach very easy for me.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of my habits is traveling. There are so many places to visit in the United States. I have spent a whole week in NYC, two weeks in Florida, visited the mountains in the west side of North Carolina, and visited Washington DC twice. One of the states that I would like to visit one day is California. I like the views of mountains near the beach. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I have a bachelor degree in Computer Science and a minor in Linguistics from East Carolina University in Greenville, NC. Before attending East Carolina University, I earned an associate degree in science from Wilson Community College, in Wilson, NC.

				Fun fact! The way we make coffee to drink was invented in Yemen.
			</p>
			<p>
				Coffee was discovered in Eastern Africa "Ethiopia", where people used to chew coffee beans.
			</p>
			<p>
				Coffee was introduced to Yemeni people by Ethiopians, then it was introduced to the world "as a drink" by the people of Yemen

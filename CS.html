				Problem solving is an essential skill for life. The most important aspect of computer science is problem solving. One of the reasons why I chosed to study computer science is that I've always liked to solve problems and make things work easier. I also love technology a lot. Even when I was a child, I used to think about how technology works. The idea of how Snapchat app works was in my head before the app was created. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Studying computer science in East Carolina University was a great experiance. It gave me the chance to learn the basics of computer science. From Algorithms and Data Sctructure, to Data Analysis and Machine Learning. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Technology changes all the time. New programming languages, new tools, and even new disciplines of computer science (AI for example). What makes me a great computer scientist is that I like learning new things. I do not want to stick with only what I have learned in college. I will always learn new things in the fields of computer science.

				<strong>Big Data Analysis</strong> was my favorite computer science course. I made an A in that course. Learning about data analysis was fun.
			</p>
			<p>
				In that course, I used alteryx and tableau to analize and visualize data. I had a team project where we analized movies data to see if the genre is correlated with how much profits a movie makes. Action genre was the one with the highest profits.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				The most important thing that I learned in that course is that 80% of data analysis projects should be spent on shaping and cleaning the data.

				<strong>Python</strong> is my favorite programming langauage. I used python in some of the computer science courses (for example, Machine Learning and Web Applications). I could have used it in the Big Data Analysis course, but my professor wanted us to use other tools.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>SQL</strong> is another language that I like a lot. I learned sql in the Database Information System course. In that course, we learned how to solve problems using Relational Algebra, and how to write sql queries. Now, I know how to created databases using sql, and run sql queries to update and manipulate the database.
			</p>
			<p>
				Moreover, I've also taught myself how to use mysql with python. I learned this skill from reading tutorials, because I like both python and sql.

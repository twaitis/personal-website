				Science is amazing! I love science in gerenal. I don't only enjoy Computer Science and Linguistics. I like reading about Geography, Political Science, Anthropologic, and even Astronomy. When I was in college, I took a lot of elective Geography, Anthropologic, Global Understanding, and Political Sciance courses. 
			</p>
			<p>
				International Studies and Global Understanding courses were my favorite elective courses. In the global understanding courses, I learned how to communicate with people with different culture and different native languages. I took three global understanding courses, where we had to chat with students from China. Brazil, Malaysia, and Peru. I was great at communicating with students from these countries, because of my linguistics and communication skills.

				When I was the Social Coordinator of the ECU Arab Students Union, I hosted three Yemen Night passport events. It was my idea to have all the Yemeni students at East Carolina University doing a presentation about Yemen and its culture, history, traditional dances, clothes, and current situation. At the end of each event, we offered some traditional Yemeni food for everyone who attended.
